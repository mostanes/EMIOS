	\section{Suggestions and references}
	This section contains further supporting material for some of the choices made in this document. These are mostly opinions and implementation details, and do not mandate requirements for interfaces.
	\subsection{Filesystem Hierarchy}
	There have been various views on the everything-is-a-file concept of UNIX/POSIX. This document has tried to be accepting of such views. It should be noted that otherwise, the main/default view of this document is along the lines of the POSIX, but with a virtual root filesystem, which is unique to the kernel instance, on top of which data is grafted through mounts and overlays.\\
	In terms of Linux naming, the initialization of the filesystem hierarchy occurs along the following lines:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The kernel creates tmpfs on /
		\item The kernel creates the basic folders /dev, /etc, /bin, /proc, /mnt, the former 3 in fact overlays.
		\item The kernel populates /dev according to kernel policy
		\item The kernel mounts /proc
		\item The kernel creates /mnt/init and mounts the initramfs there, as a system mount
		\item Being a system mount, the kernel overlays /etc and /bin on the root
		\item The kernel calls the init as /bin/init
		\item The initramfs init system populates /dev according to init policy (kernel $\rightarrow$ software distribution policy switch)
		\item The initramfs init system creates all other relevant folders in /
		\item The initramfs init system mounts the OS filesystem in /mnt/root as a system mount
		\item As a system mount, /etc and /bin are overlayed
		\item The initramfs init calls the on-disk init as /bin/init
		\item The on-disk init unmounts the /init initramfs and removes the folder
		\item The on-disk init populates /dev according to system policy (SD policy $\rightarrow$ sysadmin policy)
	\end{itemize}
